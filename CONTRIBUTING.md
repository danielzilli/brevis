# Contributing to Brevis

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow. 

* First off, please be nice and follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

* If you’re new to Brevis, be sure to read our [wiki pages](https://github.com/dlzi/brevis/wiki) to get a real understanding what is Brevis and its design principles.

## Issue Tracker

The issue tracker is the **only** channel for bug reports and features requests], so please respect the following restrictions:

* **Do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests.

* **Do not** derail or troll issues. Remember to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Bug reports

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** – check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** – try to reproduce it using the latest `master` branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** – create a live example (e.g., on [Codepen](http://codepen.io)).

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS
experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).
