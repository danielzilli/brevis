## Special Features

* Not a single `!important` rule :tada:
* Selector-First responsive design
* Logical and super easy naming convention

## More Features

#### Utility-first

Immutable classes behave exactly as expected. A class does one thing only and does it well.

#### Lightweight

Brevis is super fast, lean and play well with other technologies.

#### Low Specificity

Only the selectors with `:hover` pseudo-class have specificity of 20. All the other selectors have a specificity of 10.

#### Consistency

Consistency is in the heart of Brevis. Once you learn how it works, you'll see patterns everywhere.

#### Neutral

There's no default style to dictate how things should look like. That's entirely up to you.

#### Cohesive Scale Pattern

Brevis uses the 8-point scale pattern to ensure a consistent design.

#### Zero Dependency

* NO libraries
* NO preprocessors
* NO javascript
* NO npm
* NO grunt
* NO yarn
* NO bower
* NO travis
* NO cdn

Just a single file.
